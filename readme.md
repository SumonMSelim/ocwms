##Open Courseware Management System

Open Courseware (OCW) Management System provides a web platform for courses of study, usually within educational institutions, allow participants to be organised into cohorts, groups and roles; present resources, activities and interactions within a course structure and provide for the different stages of assessment.

The system can help the faculty of an institution to manage their course materials online so that students from anywhere can access it. The faculty will also be able to take quizzes and exams at the end of the course to evaluate the performance of their student. Student will be able to view the lectures and assignments, work with the peers and participate on the exams and quizzes.
